I am the first-year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering of University of Alberta, Canada. I am from Nanchang, China.
My research interest includes computer vision and reinforcement learning (RL). 
I also participated in projects on multi-agent RL and some data mining topics, including information retrieval and natural language processing.
