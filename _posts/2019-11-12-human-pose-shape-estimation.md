- In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that strong prior information about scene geometry can be used to improve pose estimation accuracy. To tackle this question empirically, we have assembled a novel Geometric Pose Affordance dataset, consisting of multi-view imagery of people interacting with a variety of rich 3D environments. We utilized a commercial motion capture system to collect goldstandard estimates of pose and construct accurate geometric 3D CAD models of the scene itself.

- ![](/images/fig_human_pose_shape_estimation/10.png)
- the Hourglass CNN layers [22] are used to learn the convolutional features, then the feature maps for different joints are fed to the LSTD module with CCG for feature boosting. The boosted feature maps of each joint ($$j$$) are fed to the subsequent CNN layers to generate the 2D heatmap ($$H_j$$). Depth information ($$d_j$$) of each joint is regressed based on the summation of the boosted feature maps and the 2D heatmap representations (the feature maps obtained by this summation are also concatenated and fed to the subsequent sub-network as input for further feature boosting).
- To model the graphical dependencies among different parts, instead of linking the units of the ConvLSTM sequentially as in [36], we arrange and link the units of the ConvLSTM (see Figure 1) in our LSTD module by following the above-mentioned dependency graph (see Figure 2). We call this ConvLSTM design “Graphical ConvLSTM”.

- The first (baseline) solution is a basic differentiable algebraic triangulation with an addition of confidence weights estimated from the input images. The second solution is based on a novel method of volumetric aggregation from intermediate 2D backbone feature maps. The aggregated volume is then refined via 3D convolutions that produce final 3D joint heatmaps and allow modelling a human pose prior.

_Luyang Wang, Yan Chen, Zhenhua Guo, Keyuan Qian, Mude Lin, Hongsheng Li, Jimmy S. Ren_
- We propose a principled approach to generate high quality 3D pose ground truth given any in-the-wild image with a person inside. We achieve this by first devising a novel stereo inspired neural network to directly map any 2D pose to high quality 3D counterpart. We then perform a carefully designed geometric searching scheme to further refine the joints. Based on this scheme, we build a large-scale dataset with 400,000 in-the-wild images and their corresponding 3D pose ground truth.
- The existing datasets for 2D human pose estimation such as Leeds Sports Pose dataset (LSP) [13], MPII human pose dataset (MPII) [3] and Ai Challenger dataset for 2D human pose estimation (Ai-Challenger) [43] can be used to extract the high quality 3D labels by the 3D label generator.

_Hai Ci, Chunyu Wang, Xiaoxuan Ma, Yizhou Wang_
- In this work, we propose a generic formulation where both GCN and Fully Connected Network (FCN) are its special cases. From this formulation, we discover that GCN has limited representation power when used for estimating 3D poses. We overcome the limitation by introducing Locally Connected Network (LCN) which is naturally implemented by this generic formulation. It notably improves the representation capability over GCN.
- In LCN, each node has a different filter. In addition, the dependence between the joints are specified in a more straightforward and flexible way than GCN.

_Haibo Qiu, Chunyu Wang, Jingdong Wang, Naiyan Wang, Wenjun Zeng_
- First, we introduce a cross-view fusion scheme into CNN to **jointly** estimate 2D poses for multiple views. Consequently, the 2D pose estimation for each view already benefits from other views. Second, we present a **recursive** Pictorial Structure Model to recover the 3D pose from the multi-view 2D poses. It gradually improves the accuracy of 3D pose with affordable computational cost.

-  We propose a Deep Conditional Variational Autoencoder based model that synthesizes diverse anatomically plausible 3D-pose samples conditioned on the estimated 2D-pose. We propose two strategies for obtaining the final 3D pose- (a) depthordering/ordinal relations to score and weight-average the candidate 3D-poses, referred to as OrdinalScore, and (b) with supervision from an Oracle.

_Long Zhao, Xi Peng, Yu Tian, Mubbasir Kapadia, Dimitris N. Metaxas_
- SemGCN learns to capture semantic information such as local and global node relationships, which is not explicitly represented in the graph. These semantic relationships can be learned through end-to-end training from the ground truth without additional supervision or hand-crafted rules.

- One part of the proposed reprojection network (RepNet) learns a mapping from a distribution of 2D poses to a distribution of 3D poses using an adversarial training approach. Another part of the network estimates the camera. This allows for the definition of a network layer that performs the reprojection of the estimated 3D pose back to 2D which results in a reprojection loss function.

_Junting Dong, Wen Jiang, Qixing Huang, Hujun Bao, Xiaowei Zhou_
- This paper addresses the problem of 3D pose estimation for multiple people in a few calibrated camera views. The main challenge of this problem is to find the cross-view correspondences among noisy and incomplete 2D pose predictions.
- Our key idea is to use a multi-way matching algorithm to cluster the detected 2D poses in all views. Each resulting cluster encodes 2D poses of the same person across different views and consistent correspondences across the keypoints, from which the 3D pose of each person can be effectively inferred. The proposed convex optimization based multi-way matching algorithm is efficient and robust against missing and false detections, without knowing the number of people in the scene.

_Zhengqi Li, Tali Dekel, Forrester Cole, Richard Tucker, Noah Snavely, Ce Liu, William T. Freeman_
- We argue that 3D human pose estimation from a monocular input is an inverse problem where multiple feasible solutions can exist. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to generate multiple feasible hypotheses of the 3D pose from 2D joints. In contrast to existing deep learning approaches which minimize a mean square error based on an unimodal Gaussian distribution, our method is able to generate multiple feasible hypotheses of 3D pose based on a multimodal mixture density networks.

_Helge Rhodin, Mathieu Salzmann, Pascal Fua_
- We propose to learn a geometry-aware body representation from multi-view images without annotations. To this end, we use an encoder-decoder that **predicts an image from one viewpoint given an image from another viewpoint**. Because this representation encodes 3D geometry, using it in a semi-supervised setting makes it easier to learn a mapping from it to 3D human pose.

_Xiaowei Zhou, Menglong Zhu, Georgios Pavlakos, Spyridon Leonardos, Kostantinos G. Derpanis, Kostas Daniilidis_
- The missing piece is how to integrate 2D, 3D and temporal information to recover 3D geometry and account for the uncertainties arising from the discriminative model.
- We treat 2D joint locations as latent variables whose uncertainty distributions are given by a deep fully convolutional neural network. The unknown 3D poses are modeled by a sparse representation and the 3D parameter estimates are realized via an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, where it is shown that the 2D joint location uncertainties can be conveniently marginalized out during inference.
- Sparse representation of 3D poses, $$S_t=\sum_{i=1}^kc_{it}B_{i}$$. $$\{B_i\}$$ is basis learned from MoCap dataset.

- Specifically, we train the system to predict the same pose in all views. Such a consistency constraint is necessary but not sufficient to predict accurate poses. We therefore complement it with a supervised loss aiming to predict the correct pose in a small set of labeled images, and with a regularization term that penalizes drift from initial predictions. 
- we propose a method to estimate camera pose jointly with human pose, which lets us utilize multiview footage where calibration is difficult, e.g., for pan-tilt or moving handheld cameras.

In spatial, we propose an effective and pluggable “disentangling the skeleton from the details” (DSD) module. It reduces the complexity and decouples the skeleton, which lays a good foundation for temporal modeling. In temporal, the selfattention based temporal convolution network is proposed to efficiently exploit the short and long-term temporal cues.

- perform a comprehensive study on cost and effectiveness trade-off between different annotations.
- obtain several observations: 1) 3D annotations are efficient, whereas traditional 2D annotations such as 2D keypoints and body part segmentation are less competent in guiding 3D human recovery. 2) Dense Correspondence such as DensePose is effective.
- show that incorporating dense correspondence into in the-wild 3D human recovery is promising and competitive due to its high efficiency and relatively low annotating cost
- Interestingly, in the absence of paired 3D data, the models that exploits dense correspondence can achieve 92% of the performance compared to the models trained with paired 3D data (SMPL + 3D joint).

- Exploit static 3D scene structure to better estimate human pose from monocular images. The method enforces Proximal Relationships with Object eXclusion and is called PROX. 
- (No deep learning) The **inter-penetration constraint** penalizes intersection between the body model and the surrounding 3D scene. The **contact constraint** encourages specific parts of the body to be in contact with scene surfaces if they are close enough in distance and orientation. 
- In order to get true ground-truth for the quantitative dataset, we set up a living room in a **marker-based motion capture environment**, scan the scene, and collect RGB-D images in addition to the MoCap data. We fit the SMPL-X model to the MoCap marker data using MoSh++ [41] and this provides ground-truth 3D body shape and pose. This allows us to quantitatively evaluate our method. We reconstruct in total 12 scenes and capture 20 subjects.

This feature vector is embedded in the graph defined by the template human mesh by attaching it to the 3D coordinates $$(x_i, y_i, z_i)$$ of every vertex i.

_Achuta Kadambi, Vage Taamazyan, Boxin Shi, and Ramesh Raskar_
- Coarse depth maps can be enhanced by using the shape information from polarization cues. We propose a framework to combine surface normals from polarization (hereafter polarization normals) with an aligned depth map.
- This is because polarization normals suffer from physics-based artifacts, such as azimuthal ambiguity, refractive distortion and fronto-parallel signal degradation.
