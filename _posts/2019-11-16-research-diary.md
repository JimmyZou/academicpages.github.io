### [ICLR 2020] Momentum Contrast for Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05722)
_Kaiming He, Haoqi Fan, Yuxin Wu, Saining Xie, Ross Girshick_
- From a perspective on contrastive learning as dictionary look-up, we build a dynamic dictionary with a queue and a moving-averaged encoder. This enables building a large and consistent dictionary on-the-fly that facilitates contrastive unsupervised learning.
